# datafile extents SVG representation

a small example how to create a kind of graphical representation of the list of extends in a datafile. 

This is more a POC than a product - see [graphical representation of a datafiles extents](https://berxblog.blogspot.com/2024/01/graphical-representation-of-datafiles.html). 

enjoy & good luck!
